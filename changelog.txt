Additions:
- Added Alolan Rattata and Alolan Raticate. Now where would you find them...?

Changes:
- /givepokemon random, /spawnpokemon random, and /spawnallpokemon will now only choose implemented Pokémon

Fixes:
- Fixed resource pack support for Pokémon models and forms
- Fixed shinies and form variations not displaying in the party or PC.
- Fixed servers getting stuck on shutdown due to non-closed showdown server connections
- Fixed a niche situation where players could challenge themselves. It's a little inspirational if you think about it.
- Fixed Pokémon natures not saving such that every time you restarted they had a totally different nature.
- Fixed some underground Pokémon spawning above ground instead. I'm told other weird spawns were probably fixed at the same time.
- Fixed being unable to customize keybinds on Forge
- Fixed Summary keybinding being labeled as PokéNav

Models:
- Fixed Paras and Nidoqueen looking very weird.
- Fixed Hitmonchan asserting dominance with a T-pose as well as Grimer and Muk pointing their hands to the sky.
- Fixed specific Pokémon suddenly pausing their animation after staying still for a long time.
- Fixed Mankey's feet being buried in the ground.
- Updated the Substitute model, and updated its shiny texture to be better for the red-green colourblind.
- Improved Horsea, Seadra, and Kingdra animations

Battle:
- Added Magnitude battle messages.
- Moves that are disabled or out of PP now show transparently in the battle GUI instead of being hidden completely.
- The battle message box now displays even when the battle GUI is minimised.
- Moved the R prompt in battle to be higher on the screen, so not as obstructive.
