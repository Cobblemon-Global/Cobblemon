Changes:
- /givepokemon random, /spawnpokemon random, and /spawnallpokemon will now only choose implemented Pokémon
- Moves that are disabled or out of PP now show transparently in the battle GUI instead of being hidden completely.
- The battle message box now displays even when the battle GUI is minimised.
- Moved the R prompt in battle to be higher on the screen, so not as obstructive.

Fixes:
- Fixed resource pack support for Pokémon models and forms
- Fixed shinies and form variations not displaying in the party or PC.
- Fixed servers getting stuck on shutdown due to non-closed showdown server connections
- Fixed a niche situation where players could challenge themselves. It's a little inspirational if you think about it.
- Fixed Pokémon natures not saving such that every time you restarted they had a totally different nature.
- Fixed Hitmonchan asserting dominance with a T-pose as well as Grimer and Muk pointing their hands to the sky.
- Fixed some underground Pokémon spawning above ground instead. I'm told other weird spawns were probably fixed at the same time.
